# Anapalindrome

A palindrome is a word or phrase that remains the same when spelled backward.  An "anapalindrome" is a word that, when split in half, has the same characters in the beginning as in the end.  You will be provided a list of words, output the word if it is an anapalindrome, discard the word if it is not.  An odd number of characters is allowed, just ignore the center character. Ignore case.
