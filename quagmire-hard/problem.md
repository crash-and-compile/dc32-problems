# Quagmire

We are stuck, it's a real quagmire.  The old IT guy at the company we bought also relied on security by obscurity for his own personal password manager.  He has encrypted each line using a dual-key classical cipher.  He remembers that one key he always used "KRYPTOS" and the other key was three letters, and that his passwords were all english words.  You might need some "big ram" to solve this one!
