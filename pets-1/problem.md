# Pet Encoding

We have yet another former employee relying on obsolete technology to secure the keys to the back catalog.  This time, our keys are encoded in a way we can't even print out, so we took screen shots of what they look like.  We are pretty sure this one goes back to the early 8-bit days.  Your input is base64 encoded PNGs, one per line, output plain text, one per line.
