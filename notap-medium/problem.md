# No Tap

You will be given transcripts of 9-pin no-tap bowling games.  Each throw is 0-9 or X for 10. Each character in the input is one throw.  In no-tap a 9 or 10 counts as a strike for the first throw of a frame, but than that, standard bowling scoring rules apply.  Games are 10 frames, but you must determine where frames begin and end.  Output is the score of the game under 9-pin no-tap rules, one per line.
