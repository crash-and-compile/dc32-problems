# Chainwords

You will be given a set of words.  Find the longest string that can be constructed by matching the last letter of a word to the first letter of a different word, chaining them together.  The output is the character count of the resulting longest chain.  If no chains can form, output the length of the longest word. For example, "top cat ram" -> "cattop" -> 6
